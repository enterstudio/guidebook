There are some great resources for street design, such as the [Urban Street Design Guide][NACTO] by the National Association of City Transportation Officials ([NACTO](http://nacto.org/)). The Boston Globe called it “cutting-edge, unconventional, and willing to go out on a limb. [It’s the Jon Stewart of traffic manuals](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/04/05/starts-and-stops/mhOziSyQznrGK5hzHpHU7M/story.html).”

The Streetmix segments guide, then, is the _The Colbert Report_ spinoff to NACTO’s _Daily Show_.

We’ve created this guide solely as a resource to help shape the defaults for Streetmix. It is intended to be a “living document,” changing frequently and with little notice, based on contributions from the community and as best practices evolve around the world. So if you've got a real project, always refer to local laws and regulations first &mdash; and be wary about citing Streetmix as a primary source for information.
