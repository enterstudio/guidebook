Generally, Streetmix adopts the second edition of the [NACTO Urban Bikeway Design Guide](http://nacto.org/cities-for-cycling/design-guide/) (released 2012) for bike paths and bike facilities. Prior to its development and release in the United States, nearly all bike path design guidelines were based partially on guesswork and partially the _AASHTO Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities_ (1999).
