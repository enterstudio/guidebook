### Variants

- **Different vehicle types**

  - Trolleys
  - Streetcars
  - Light rails

- **Direction**

  - Inbound
  - Outbound

- **Infrastructure**

  - Curb-separated
  - Shared (in drive lane)

### Dimensioning

======================  ======================  ======================
Default width           Minimum width           Maximum width
======================  ======================  ======================
12 ft                   10 ft *(unconfirmed)*   None (?)
======================  ======================  ======================

**Default width**

12 ft is a realistic default, according to Patrick McDonough.

**Minimum width**

10 ft *(unconfirmed)*, to match the default width of a drive lane, and in the absense of any definite minimum width standards, to be just larger than any known light rail vehicles.

  - According to `Market Street Railway`_, the widths of most streetcars are between 8’-0” to 9’-0”.

  - According to our contact Patrick McDonough (in Raleigh), no light rail lane in projects that he has seen is currently smaller than 12 feet. He is not sure whether this is an enforced standard of minimum, but believes it to be a reasonable default, and that it’s possible engineers can make light rail lanes work in 10’. According to his scan of the Booz Allen Hamilton “North American Light Rail Vehicles” book,  most light rail vehicles are between 8.5 to 9 feet wide. Skoda, the primary manufacturer of modern North American streetcars, has a vehicle just 8’-1” wide.

  - Another option for vehicle separation is ground-level safety features that enforce traffic separation like the “traffic exclusion domes” used by the `Houston LRT <http://www.lightrail.com/photos/houston/hmta92.jpg>`_.

    - “Traffic exclusion domes” are not the actual name of those things.

  - A measurement of the curb-to-curb clear area for a dedicated light rail line at 1st Ave and Jefferson in Phoenix, AZ, measures 12ft.

    -  According to a guy at Railways, the default standard width preferred by light rail agencies is 14ft (8ft “header” area + 3ft on either side).

**Maximum width**

None? (Currently set to 14’ in accordance to the Railways guy.)
