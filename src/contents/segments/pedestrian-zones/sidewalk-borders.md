**Minimum width**

A number of people have cited that tree planters should not be less than 2-ft because “landscape architects hate that, even though they exist anyway”.

>  “Some limit on large trees... I don't know the details, but the root system of large trees play a huge role on placement in the road.  I think I could make a 2 foot median with large tree, which isn't possible.”
    — Marc Caswell

> “In the context of pedestrian safety, street trees are similar to parked cars in the way that they protect the sidewalks from the moving cars beyond them. They also create a perceptual narrowing of the street that lowers driving speeds. But they only perform this role when they are sturdy and planted tightly enough to register in drivers’ vision. “Arboring” shade trees are also essential to pedestrian comfort in a number of ways. They reduce ambient temperatures in warm weather, absorb stormwater and tailpipe emissions, provide UV protection, and reduce the effects of wind. A consistent cover of trees can go a long way towards mitigating the impacts of an otherwise uncomfortable street space.”

> “As it pertains specifically to the provision of clear zones along roadways, […] an investigation of arterial streets in Toronto [...] found that the presence of street-trees and other vertical objects along the road edge correlated with a 5 to 20 percent decline in midblock crashes. (Accidents at intersections were relatively unaffected.) …. Most recently, Eric Dumbaugh compared four years of crash statistics from two different sections of Colonial Drive in Orlando, and found that the section without trees and other vertical objects experienced 12 percent more midblock crashes, 45 percent more injurious crashes, and a dramatically higher number of fatal crashes: six vs. zero.”
