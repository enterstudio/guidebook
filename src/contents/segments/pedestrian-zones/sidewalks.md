Sidewalks are essential for pedestrian activity, and when they are made as safe and welcoming as possible for people, it helps create lively, vibrant streets.

&nbsp;                   | &nbsp;
------------------------ | --------------------
Default width            | 6 ft
Minimum width            | 4 ft
Maximum width            | None

##### Notes

  * 2.4m (8-ft) minimum (total, including buffer).
  * Residential areas 4ft-8ft (1.2-2.4m) with 2ft buffers

> “This point sometimes doesn’t need mentioning, because few American cities have forgotten about sidewalk width, but certain minimums must be maintained. Generally, absent pedestrian crowding, most sidewalks need provide at least a 6-foot clear zone to be comfortable, but this condition changes when parallel parking or mature shade trees are missing. In these cases, it is more important to provide the car-and-tree buffer than it is to widen the pedestrian clear zone, but an ideal solution accomplishes both.”

> A city street equipped to handle strangers, and to make a safety asset, in itself, our of the presence of strangers, as the streets of successful city neighborhoods always do, must have three main qualities:

> First, there must be a clear demarcation between what is public space and what is private space. Public and private spaces cannot ooze into each other as they do typically in suburban settings or in projects.

> Second, there must be eyes upon the street, eyes belonging to those we might call the natural proprietors of the street. The buildings on a street equipped to handle strangers and to insure the safety of both residents and strangers, must be oriented to the street. They cannot turn their backs or blank sides on it and leave it blind.

> And third, the sidewalk must have users on it fairly continuously, both to add to the number of effective eyes on the street and to induce the people in buildings along the street to watch the sidewalks in sufficient numbers. Nobody enjoys sitting on a stoop or looking out a window at an empty street. Almost nobody does such a thing. Large numbers of people entertain themselves, off and on, by watching street activity.
