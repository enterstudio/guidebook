Estonia-based architecture firm [Salto Architects][Salto] designed and built _[Fast Track][Fast Track]_, a 51-meter (about 167 feet) installation that acts both as park infrastructure and art piece that gets participants in a playful mood. It was installed for the [Archstoyanie Festival][Archstoyanie], which took place in summer of 2012 at Nikola-Lenivets Park in Russia (about a 213km, 3-hour drive southwest of Moscow). To build it and allow for jumping, the architects had to dig out the ground below the trampoline.

The benefits of trampoline lanes are not well researched, if at all, but _[The Chattanooga Bystander][Bystander]_ proposed trampoline lanes for downtown streets, complete with mocked up images of jumping pedestrians in the air, and then invented some information which sounds completely plausible:

> City Transportation Director Dana Wakemouth said that Chattanooga would be the first city in the American South to have municipal trampoline lanes, if it is awarded a $20 million state grant this summer.

> “Trampoline lanes are a revolutionary new idea, and Chattanooga is happy to lead the way,” said Wakemouth. “The lanes are made from a network of durable metal springs covered by a space-age spongy rubber material that was used by NASA on its Mars landing rover.”

> “Jumping is faster and healthier than walking, and having separate lanes would make sure that jumpers don’t collide with pedestrians, bicyclists or motor vehicles,” said Wakemouth. “Also, at intersections, jumpers don’t need to wait for the stoplight to change color, since they can simply just jump over the entire road, if they are good enough.”
