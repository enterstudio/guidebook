Many city planners and advocacy groups use Streetmix to create illustrations quickly and easily. Some are explorative sketches that lead to fuller studies while in other cases Streetmix is used for full-fledged presentation-quality graphics for proposals and plans. Here are just a sampling of some of our favorite projects.

#### Lakeshore Drive, New Orleans
##### Cycling and pedestrian advocacy on the banks of the Pontchartrain

For decades, New Orleans' popular four-lane waterfront roadway on the southern shore of Lake Pontchartrain turned into a two-lane, westbound-only street on weekends and holidays, as a result of the state's Levee Board recommendation that half the road be closed for emergency access. By freeing Lakeshore Drive from weekend automobile traffic, this created growing recreational use for bikers and pedestrians. In April 2014, the Levee Board's successor agency lifted the closure requirement, restoring four-lane automobile traffic on all days of the week.

Concerned with equitable mobility and accessibility, and the loss of safety for non-drivers, bike advocacy group [Bike Easy](http://bikeeasy.org/) responded with a proposal to create permanent, dedicated cycling lanes and wider pedestrian walkways, while preserving two-way road traffic using just two lanes instead of four in the existing right-of-way. Using Streetmix, the group quickly assembled a 14-page illustrated proposal that allowed them to go to the state's lakefront property management agency with this option, leading to the creation of a special "Blue Ribbon Committee" to review its effects.
