Streetmix is designed to be accessible, fun, and educational for people of all ages and backgrounds, making it an ideal way for planners to bring community members into the street design process.

Gather community feedback in an online campaign, or bring Streetmix to a local meeting. Many communities have already begun to do this. Here are some of their stories of what they've done.

Here are some ways to engage your community! One method is linking to a pre-made street segment (or several) on Streetmix that represent the existing cross-section of a street (or several different cross-sections if it changes dramatically across its length). If your agency or city has a Twitter account, it would help to create this section while logged into it, so that the street section is attached to its rightful owner.

An alternative to pre-making the existing cross-section will be to make several proposed alternatives, if you're already far enough in the process to have these ready.

Lastly, as users modify the street from your links, it will create new versions under a different URL. They can then share these links back to you so that you can see how others have re-imagined your street.
