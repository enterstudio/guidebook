Streetmix is designed to be accessible, fun, and educational for people of all ages and backgrounds, making it an ideal way for planners to bring community members into the street design process.

Many communities have brought Streetmix to a local meeting, or gathered community feedback in an online campaign. Here are just a few of their stories.

#### Oakland, California
##### Quick, effective, and relatable communication

In 2013, the City of Oakland sought public feedback on options that could balance transportation modes on one of their iconic thoroughfares, Telegraph Avenue. Using Streetmix, the City published the [Roadway Design Options Report](http://www2.oaklandnet.com/n/OAK046665) showing variations of the corridor with bike lanes, more effective transit, and improving pedestrian safety. Then, in a series of open houses, the City was able to illustrate these options, along with the "most likely" scenarios, to gather input and gauge community priorities.

#### Broward County, Florida
##### Community-driven engagement at a public conference

Broward County is Florida's second-most populous county, but was also ranked as one of the most dangerous places in the country for cyclists and pedestrians, because of the areaâ€™s dependence on the personal automobile. This left their aging population at risk, who had lost the ability to be independently mobile, and their younger population, less likely to own cars, were more likely to leave the county. Recognizing that streets must be planned and designed to serve residents of all ages and abilities, react to changing trends, and to reduce traffic-related deaths and injuries, the county launched an ambitious [Complete Streets](http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/complete-streets) initiative in 2011.

Broward's Metropolitan Planning Organization adopted Streetmix in all of their planning efforts. In January 2013, they hosted a Safe Streets Summit, open to the public. Attendees broke out in to groups to review parameters, discuss potential designs, and apply their own solutions on Streetmix. This enabled people to realize their own priorities and have a say in shaping Complete Streets proposals throughout the county.

#### Kansas City, Missouri
##### Leveraging online crowdsourcing platforms for greater reach

When the city of Kansas City, Missouri announced plans to add or extend streetcar lines on three downtown streets, cycling and pedestrian advocacy group BikeWalk KC urged officials to take a closer look at adding improved facilities for other transportation modes within their scope of work. No strangers to Streetmix -- the group previously used it to create dedicated bike-lane proposals for Armour Boulevard -- BikeWalk KC decided to turn its process outward, and begin involving the community as well.

Community crowdsourcing platforms, like <a href='http://www.mindmixer.com/'>Mindmixer</a> (pictured above) or <a href='http://www.neighborland.com/'>Neighborland</a> are designed to be online spaces where communities can gather feedback and input from local stakeholders. Using Streetmix's ability to share links and save images, participants can contribute their own mixes in a digital forum for discussion.

## Getting started

Streetmix doesn't impose a particular a way to engage the community -- how you design your campaign is up to you. This general outline will help you get started.

* **Start with existing conditions.** When preparing your campaign, create one or more pre-made sections on Streetmix that represent the existing cross-section of your street. Make as many as you need, especially if your project has more than one street, or if the street has different conditions along its length.
* **Optionally, create proposed alternatives.** If you're far enough along in the project, you can also create proposed alternatives to work from.
* **Make it official.** Create the street under your agency, city, or project Twitter account. Link to it from a project page, like a website, blog, or a tweet.
* **Specify the project parameters.** Not everything is possible in the real world, but digitally, users can be as creative as they want. Being upfront about the constraints and opportunities faced by the actual project can help users make more informed decisions.
* **Promote the engagement.** Whether you're at a public meeting or are engaging digitally, make sure that the links to your sections are easily reachable. If you're at a public meeting, provide ways to get online and assistants to help those in need. Online, reach out in as many ways you can: social media, news outlets, official sites.
* **Encourage discussion.** Streets are shared by everyone, and so should the discussion. In a public meeting, attendees should be encouraged to work together and discuss ideas as a group. Online, submissions can be posted publicly and on a system that allows for comments and further remixes.
* **Collect responses.** Remixes automatically have unique URLs, so that they can be shared and linked to in the future. Ask users to submit these links back to you, or save the images and upload them to your site.
* **Publish results.** Show what people have created, and show your findings, aggregated data, and decisions that have resulted from this public feedback. Provide a way to follow up to keep the conversation going.
