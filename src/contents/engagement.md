Streetmix is designed to be accessible, fun, and educational for people of all ages and backgrounds, making it an ideal way for planners to bring community members into the street design process.

Gather community feedback in an online campaign, or bring Streetmix to a local meeting. Many communities have already begun to do this. Here are some of their stories of what they've done.

- Rapid ideation and relatable communication (Oakland, California)

- Bring Streetmix to an event (Broward County, Florida)


#### Oakland, California
##### Rapid proposal ideation for relatable communication (wordy?)

The City of Oakland proposed to add bike lanes, more effective transit, and pedestrian facilities to one of their iconic thoroughfares, Telegraph Avenue. They used Streetmix to illustrate their a series of preliminary designs and brought them to community meetings to gather input.

"Quote from a person", said Priscilla FishingChick, community manager for the Broward MPO. In January 2014, the MPO did their Safe Streets Summit to present a bunch of complete streets proposals and celebrate or talk about their complete streets guides.

#### Kansas City, Missouri
##### Leveraging online crowdsourcing platforms for greater digital reach

When the city of Kansas City, Missouri announced plans to add or extend streetcar lines on three downtown streets, cycling and pedestrian advocacy group BikeWalk KC urged officials to take a closer look at adding improved facilities for other transportation modes within their scope of work. No strangers to Streetmix -- the group previously used it to create dedicated bike-lane proposals for Armour Boulevard -- BikeWalk KC decided to turn its process outward, and begin involving the community as well.

Community crowdsourcing platforms, like <a href='http://www.mindmixer.com/'>Mindmixer</a> (pictured above) or <a href='http://www.neighborland.com/'>Neighborland</a> are designed to be online spaces where communities can gather feedback and input from local stakeholders. Using Streetmix's ability to share links and save images, participants can contribute their own mixes in a digital forum for discussion.

Here are some ways to engage your community! One method is linking to a pre-made street segment (or several) on Streetmix that represent the existing cross-section of a street (or several different cross-sections if it changes dramatically across its length). If your agency or city has a Twitter account, it would help to create this section while logged into it, so that the street section is attached to its rightful owner.

An alternative to pre-making the existing cross-section will be to make several proposed alternatives, if you're already far enough in the process to have these ready.

Lastly, as users modify the street from your links, it will create new versions under a different URL. They can then share these links back to you so that you can see how others have re-imagined your street.
