Streetmix handbook
==================

Work in progress.

## Workflow notes

1. Files are generated as a static files into the `./dist/` folder. Run `http-server dist` to serve the distribution folder to `http://localhost:8080` (or next available port).
2. Gulp is the primary task runner / build system. Running `gulp` with no other options just starts a watcher to perform various tasks and start a LiveReload server.
3. LiveReload must be installed as a Chrome extension. Open the local server and then connect LiveReload on that page in order to reload changes.
