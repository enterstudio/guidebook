<p>Lane widths typically fall between 2.7m (9ft) and 3.6m (12ft). For the urban contexts where Streetmix is most useful, a 3.0m (10ft) lane width is ideal. Some design guides will prefer 3.3m (11ft) lanes, but we will follow Jeff Speck’s lead (and the lead of other progressive planners) in setting the 3.0m (10ft) widths as typical, for safety reasons outlined below.</p>
<p>There may be outlying scenarios where wider lanes are needed, but one should not assume these to be the default conditions: a 12-ft lane may be desirable to provide passing clearances for large commercial vehicles on two-lane highways, and widths less than 10-ft might be more desirable in residential areas where pedestrian crossings exist and lower traffic speeds are needed. See also [Queueing streets].</p>
<p>When there is more than one lane in a direction, sometimes the outside drive lane can be wider than inside drive lanes, and even increased beyond the 12-ft maximum range, to accommodate larger vehicles (such as trucks) as well as bicycles (see also sharrow). Note that when space allows, a dedicated bike lane is always preferred and safer than a sharrow.</p>
<h4 id="auto-centric-design-considerations">Auto-centric design considerations</h4>
<p>Any lane improvement made to increase traffic flow (or speed) will correlate with an increase in pedestrian or bicyclist injuries or deaths, and reduce walkability. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>One way streets</li>
<li>“Fat” lanes (see Walkable City, “<a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/louh/9f75daf8acb37e2040b7">Fat Lanes</a>“)</li>
<li>More lanes than actually needed (see Walkable City, “Protect the Pedestrian”), and Cedar Rapid Complete Streets Code (June 14, 2013 draft, page 12)</li>
</ul>
<p>The desire to keep lanes wide, relatively free of traffic, and clear of obstructions is a relic of auto-centric traffic planning, catering to habitual drivers. If you’re one of those people: we get it. People hate being stuck in traffic. But, as the adage goes, you’re not <em>stuck</em> in traffic; you <em>are</em> traffic.</p>
<p>Transportation planners are now understanding <em>induced demand</em>, that is, whenever you expand road capacity for cars, <em>you end up getting more cars</em>, until the newly induced traffic feels about as bad as the original traffic problem you were trying to solve. In the past, the solution would have been to simply expand the roads again, and again, and again. But this is a losing battle against the availability of space, and we only have a finite amount of that. If only comedian Steven Wright was right, when he dryly noted, “The Universe is expanding. That should help with the traffic.”</p>
<p>Counter-intuitively for most drivers, the only reasonable solution to reducing traffic is to take <em>away</em> automobile capacity. A <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/02/17/traffic-which-boston-area-neighborhoods-are-blame/h5qqR3CrHDM3xCNsTqdYxH/story.html">2013 study of commuter patterns in the Boston metropolitan area</a> found that removing just 1% of cars could have dramatic effects, allowing other drivers to get home from work 18% faster. And where do those other 1% of commuters go? Other forms of transportation, like <a href="/segments/public-transport/">light rail</a>, <a href="/segments/public-transport/">commuter rail</a>, and <a href="/segments/public-transport/">buses</a>, for example, can pick up much of the slack.</p>
<h4 id="correlation-between-lane-width-and-speed">Correlation between lane width and speed</h4>
<p>There have been plenty of studies that correlate, generally, lane width and comfortable driving speed. It is succinctly summarized in the Complete Streets Code for Cedar Rapids (June 14, 2013 draft; page 4-5):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Different-width traffic lanes correspond to different travel speeds. A typical urban lane width is 10 feet, which comfortably supports speeds of 30 mph. A typical highway lane width is 12 feet, which comfortably supports speeds of 70 mph. Drivers instinctively understand the connection between lane width and driving speed, and often speed up when presented with wider lanes, even in urban locations. For this reason, any urban lane width in excess of 10 feet encourages speeds that increase risk to pedestrians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on page 6-7:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to state explicitly that the above discussion represents a significant departure from how traffic safety has been discussed in past decades, and how it has been practiced in places like Cedar Rapids, where the conventional approach to improving driver safety has been to reduce opportunities for conflict by widening travel lanes and providing recovery zones along roadways. Such an approach, derived from highway engineering, seems logical enough in theory, but fails in practice because it presumes that motorists do not drive faster when opportunities for conflicts are eliminated. Recent research would suggest that this presumption is false.</p>
<p>In their 2009 study, “The Built Environment and Traffic Safety: A Review of Empirical Evidence,” professors Reid Ewing and Eric Dumbaugh describe the situation this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Considered broadly, the fundamental shortcoming of conventional traffic safety theory is that it fails to account for the moderating role of human behavior on crash incidence. Decisions to. . . widen specific roadways to make them more forgiving are based on the assumption that in so doing, human behavior will remain unchanged. And it is precisely this assumption—that human behavior can be treated as a constant, regardless of design—that accounts for the failure of conventional safety practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This failure continues to be a costly one. In one study, presented at the 80th Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board, Rutgers professor Robert Noland calculated that increased lane widths could be blamed for approximately 900 additional traffic fatalities per year.</p>
