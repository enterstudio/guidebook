<p>Under the leadership of transportation commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan, New York City rapidly transformed streets and public spaces from dangerous traffic-heavy corridors to friendlier, safer streets with pedestrian plazas and dedicated bikeways, simply by restriping lanes and putting down paint and planters. “You can remake your streets quickly, inexpensively, it can provide immediate benefits, and it can be quite popular,” Sadik-Khan said <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/janette_sadik_khan_new_york_s_streets_not_so_mean_any_more?language=en">to a TED audience in 2013</a>, “You just need to look at them a little differently.” Dedicated to making many improvements in a <a href="http://www.pps.org/reference/lighter-quicker-cheaper-a-low-cost-high-impact-approach/">quicker, cheaper way</a>, the NYC Department of Transportation used Streetmix to propose alternatives for a particularly dangerous stretch of Kent Avenue in Brooklyn, after a hit-and-run driver zooming at more than twice the posted speed limit killed two people in another car in March 2013.</p>

<p>“When roads are overbuilt, this is the way people drive,” said DOT’s Ted Wright to <a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2013/12/18/dot-plans-bike-lane-extension-traffic-calming-on-deadly-section-of-kent-ave/">Streetsblog</a>. By year’s end, DOT proposed removing one lane of traffic in order to slow traffic and save lives, but to make the change quickly, the lanes needed to be restriped without the expense of moving the existing curbs and medians. The proposal also added a two-way protected green bike lane, where previously it only had a single unpainted bike lane in one direction. A graphically savvy staff created an illustrated presentation by customizing their Streetmix images. The Brooklyn Community Board’s transportation committee unanimously supported this project in January 2014, and the Kent Avenue reconfiguration project was completed by May 2014.</p>

<p>North Avenue is Burlington’s longest street, a historic route linking downtown Burlington with the New North End neighborhood, built in the 1900s as a two-lane rural road but seeing an evolution to a two- to four-lane minor arterial in its later years. In 2013, the Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission (CCRPC) and the City of Burlington initiated <a href="http://www.ccrpcvt.org/transportation/corridors/north-avenue-corridor-study/">the North Avenue Corridor Study</a> along a 2.8-mile segment, responding to newer desires for North Avenue to become a “Complete Street.” The resulting study, published in draft form in October 2014, provided recommendations to improve access and safety for all modes of transportation and users of all ages, including Streetmix illustrations to show both short-term and long-term conceptual implementations.</p>

<p>Local Motion, a Burlington-based walk-bike advocacy organization, represented a community voice in strong support for the direction of the new options, but saw room for improvement. “Local Motion’s role was to show how we could do better than sharrows and conventional bike lanes right now, within the existing curb-to-curb width,” said Jason Van Driesche of Local Motion.  “Streetmix was essential to our being able to shift the conversation to protected bike lanes as the best near-term option.” The Burlington City Council voted on October 6, 2014 to approve a plan that includes continuous bike lanes and a protected lane pilot.  About 120 people attended the council meeting, with 34 of 40 people who spoke voicing their support for the plan.</p>
