<p>Under the leadership of transportation commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan, New York City rapidly transformed streets and public spaces from dangerous traffic-heavy corridors to friendlier, safer streets with pedestrian plazas and dedicated bikeways, simply by restriping lanes and putting down paint and planters. “You can remake your streets quickly, inexpensively, it can provide immediate benefits, and it can be quite popular,” Sadik-Khan said <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/janette_sadik_khan_new_york_s_streets_not_so_mean_any_more?language=en">to a TED audience in 2013</a>, “You just need to look at them a little differently.” Dedicated to making many improvements in a <a href="http://www.pps.org/reference/lighter-quicker-cheaper-a-low-cost-high-impact-approach/">quicker, cheaper way</a>, the NYC Department of Transportation was able to do that with Streetmix.</p>

<p>In March 2013, a hit-and-run driver driving at more than twice the posted speed limit killed two people in another car on a particularly dangerous stretch of Kent Avenue in Brooklyn. “When roads are overbuilt, this is the way people drive,” said DOT’s Ted Wright to <a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2013/12/18/dot-plans-bike-lane-extension-traffic-calming-on-deadly-section-of-kent-ave/">Streetsblog</a>. By year’s end, DOT proposed removing one lane of traffic in order to slow traffic and save lives, but to make the change quickly, the lanes needed to be restriped without the expense of moving the existing curbs and medians. The proposal also added a two-way protected green bike lane, where previously it only had a single unpainted bike lane in one direction. A graphically savvy staff created an illustrated presentation by customizing their Streetmix images. The Brooklyn Community Board’s transportation committee unanimously supported this project in January 2014, and the Kent Avenue reconfiguration project was completed by May 2014.</p>

<p>North Avenue is Burlington’s longest street. City/RPC proposed long term changes to the street, and Local Motion proposed improvements for the short-term. Burlington City Council voted to approve Local Motion’s proposals with modificatiosn on October 6, 2014.
Our contact is at Local Motion, but the Chittendon RPC is using Streetmix in its documents as well.</p>

<p>For decades, New Orleans’ popular four-lane waterfront roadway on the southern shore of Lake Pontchartrain turned into a two-lane, westbound-only street on weekends and holidays, as a result of the state’s Levee Board recommendation that half the road be closed for emergency access. By freeing Lakeshore Drive from weekend automobile traffic, it created a <em>de facto</em> designated route for recreational bikers and pedestrians. But in the spring of 2014, the Levee Board’s successor agency lifted the closure requirement, restoring four-lane automobile traffic on all days of the week.</p>
<p>Concerned with equitable mobility and accessibility, and the loss of safety for non-drivers, bike advocacy group <a href="http://bikeeasy.org/">Bike Easy</a> responded with a proposal to create permanent, dedicated cycling lanes and wider pedestrian walkways, while preserving two-way road traffic using just two lanes instead of four in the existing right-of-way. Using Streetmix, the group quickly assembled a 14-page illustrated proposal that allowed them to go to the state’s lakefront property management agency with this option, leading to the creation of a special “Blue Ribbon Committee” to review its effects.</p>
